📌 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This project develops a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and more.
The goal is to provide a data-driven tool that can support healthcare professionals in early detection and risk assessment of cardiovascular diseases.

🎯 **OBJECTIVE**

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on the heart disease dataset.

- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and correlations.

- Build, train, and evaluate multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM & Random Forest).

- Select the best-performing model for prediction.

- Deploy the model for real-world usability.


📂**DATASET:** Heart Disease Data Report
- Features include: (Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, Rest ECG, Max Heart Rate, Exercise Induced Angina, Oldpeak, ST Slope).
- Target: 1 = Heart Disease Present, 0 = No Heart Disea

🔍 **EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

- Distribution of patient attributes.
- Correlation heatmap between features and target.
- Outlier detection and handling.
- Class imbalance check

🤖 **MODELS IMPLEMENTED**

- 📉 Logistic Regression.
- ⚖ Support Machine Vector (SMV).
- 🌲 Decision Tree.
- 🌲🌲🌲 Random Forest

**EVALUATION METRICS:**
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall 
- F1-score

🚀 **RESULTS**

- Best Model: 📉 Logistic Regression
- Accuracy Achieved: 85.87%
- Feature Importance: Age, Cholesterol, Resting BP, Max Heart Rate, and Chest Pain Type were the most influential predictors.

📈 **FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS**

- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV/Optuna.
- Use ensemble methods or XGBoost/LightGBM for better accuracy.
- Deploy model as a web API (Flask/FastAPI).
- Integrate with healthcare dashboards.
